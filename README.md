# 2d-game-physics

My own 2d rigid body physics engine written from scratch in C.
Still a WIP, working on this in my (very) limited free time.

Features:
    * TODO

Graphics is done with raylib.

I had very ambitious goals for this one but I ended up getting sidetracked, so I'll just leave it 
like this for now, but maybe I'll improve it in the future. 

I have too many ideas about other projects that I want to try right now, and too little time.
